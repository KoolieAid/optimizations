# Introduction
This is a config framework, with its main purpose being to replace defaults with more optimal values, providing large performance gains with minimal impacts to visual quality, and general improvements towards everything else.

It is very customizable and will under most circumstances appeal to your personal preferences.

# Cleanup
**If you never used configs by others (or already cleaned), ignore this.** 

Open Steam, go to your Library, right click 'Team Fortress 2', click on Properties.

Click on Local Files, then 'Browse Local Files'.

Open the **tf** folder, then ***delete*** the **cfg** folder.

`This will reset any settings you have changed within Team Fortress 2.`

Now, click on 'Verify Integrity of Game Files' and wait, this is in the same tab as 'Browse Local Files', there will no longer be conflicts after Steam is done verifying.

# Warning to nVidia users
**Do not use 388.13 drivers**, on Pascal cards and possibly others, these specific drivers cause severe stuttering (random FPS drops) across many games.
You can upgrade (or downgrade) here: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx

388.00 drivers seem to work very well as of November 12th, 2017.

# Installation
Download the latest version from: **https://github.com/source-engine/optimizations/releases/latest**
